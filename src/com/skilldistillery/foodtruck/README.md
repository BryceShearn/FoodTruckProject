## Food Truck Project

### Description

* This project is designed with a user interface allowing for users to enter an amount of food truck reviews comprising of the name, food type, and level of satisfaction up to five reviews per session.
* Once at least one review is submitted the user will be allowed to:  
* view all community reviews.
* view the average of all existing reviews
* view the highest rated food truck
* exit for the day!

### Topics and Technologies Used

* Constructors

* Inheritance

* Polymorphism

* Encapsulation

* Abstraction

* Visibility

### How to Run


* run FoodTruckApp.java while ensuring FoodTruck.java is attached, no additional parameters are required.
* user is prompted with a window upon run prompting for at-least one review prior to viewing the community window.

### Lessons Learned

* Being able to separate classes allows for easily locating and separating aspects of programs. When coupling this aspect using constructors this allows for fixes to be easily located, pin-pointed, and addressed without having to dig for issues as they arise. If future modifications are required in a program constructors can be modified easily as they are pre-established.
